# Photo show

Hi! This is just a little example of how to show images from an API. I have used React + Vite to display the photos, creating different components to show the parts of the web -navbar, footer- and the pages -home, photos-. If you try to go somewhere else, a carp will get into your path. 

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
